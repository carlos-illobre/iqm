This project is for teaching pourpose. It was my first NodeJS project.
It shows how to create a REST API in NodeJS. There is only one html page for testing.
It was created with vanilla javascript to show the integration with other clients as simple as posible.

5) npm start
6) http://localhost:8080

# Features

# TODOs
1) Create a real REST API using HAL for HATEOAS
